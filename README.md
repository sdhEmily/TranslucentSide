## Enabling Translucency

### If you use Windows [Mica for Everyone](https://github.com/MicaForEveryone/MicaForEveryone) is known to play decently, but it can have issues.

### You can achieve the same look on Vencord with macOS by doing as follows:

1. Go to Settings > Vencord, then toggle "Enable Translucent Window".
2. Then scroll down and set "Window vibrancy style" to "HUD"
